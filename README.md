## Creasol DomBus modules
Our industrial and home automation modules are designed to be
* very low power (**around 10mW with relays OFF**)
* reliable (**no disconnections**)
* bus connected (**no radiofrequency interference, no battery to replace**).

Modules are available in two version:
1. with **DomBus proprietary protocol**, working with [Domoticz](https://www.domoticz.com) only
2. with **Modbus standard protocol**, working with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io), [OpenHAB](https://www.openhab.org), [Node-RED](https://nodered.org)

### DomBusEVSE - EVSE module to build a Smart Wallbox / EV charging station
<a href="https://store.creasol.it/DomBusEVSE"><img src="https://images.creasol.it/creDomBusEVSE_200.png" alt="DomBusEVSE smart EVSE module to make a Smart Wallbox EV Charging station" style="float: left; margin-right: 2em;" align="left" /></a>
Complete solution to make a Smart EVSE, **charging the electric vehicle using only energy from renewable source (photovoltaic, wind, ...), or adding 25-50-75-100% of available power from the grid**.

* Single-phase and three-phases, up to 36A (8kW or 22kW)
* Needs external contactor, RCCB (protection) and EV cable
* Optional power meter to measure charging power, energy, voltage and power factor
* Optional power meter to measure the power usage from the grid (not needed if already exists)
* **Two max grid power thresholds** can be programmed: for example, in Italy who have 6kW contractual power can drain from the grid Max (6* 1.27)=7.6kW for max 90 minutes followed by (6* 1.1)=6.6kW for another 90 minutes. **The module can use ALL available power** when programmed to charge at 100%.
* **Works without the domotic controller** (stand-alone mode), and **can also work with charging current set by the domotic controller (managed mode)**
